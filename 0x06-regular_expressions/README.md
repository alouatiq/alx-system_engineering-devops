# 0x06. Regular Expressions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, primarily in Ruby. Each script in this project matches specific patterns as outlined in the project tasks.

## Files and Descriptions

- **0-simply_match_school.rb**: Matches the exact string "School".
- **1-repetition_token_0.rb**: Matches strings with "hb", 2-5 "t"s, and "n".
- **2-repetition_token_1.rb**: Matches "h" followed by optional "b", "tn".
- **3-repetition_token_2.rb**: Matches "hb" followed by one or more "t"s and "n".
- **4-repetition_token_3.rb**: Matches "hb" followed by zero or more "t"s and "n".
- **5-beginning_and_end.rb**: Matches "h" followed by any character and "n".
- **6-phone_number.rb**: Matches exactly 10-digit numbers without spaces or symbols.
- **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb**: Extracts and outputs only uppercase letters.
- **100-textme.rb**: Extracts sender, receiver, and flags from log entries.

## Requirements
- All scripts are executable Ruby scripts and conform to the Oniguruma regex library.
- Each script processes a single argument passed via the command line.
