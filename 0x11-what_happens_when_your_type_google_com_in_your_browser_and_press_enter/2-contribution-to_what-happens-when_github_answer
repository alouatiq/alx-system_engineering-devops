# Contribution to "What Happens When" GitHub Project

## Overview
As part of my technical contributions to open-source projects, I have submitted a pull request to the **"What Happens When"** repository on GitHub. This project provides an in-depth breakdown of the entire process that occurs when a user types `google.com` into a web browser and presses enter.

## Contribution Details
### **Title of Contribution**
**"Added Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution section"**

### **Pull Request Link**
[PR #2490: Added Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when/pull/2490)

### **Summary of Changes**
In this contribution, I have introduced a **Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution** section that explains:
- How web traffic is distributed across multiple servers.
- Different types of load balancing strategies:
  - **Round Robin**
  - **Least Connections**
  - **IP Hashing**
  - **Geographic Load Balancing**
- The role of **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** in optimizing traffic flow.
- The impact of **load balancing on scalability, performance, and fault tolerance**.

### **Why This Contribution Matters**
Load balancing plays a crucial role in modern web infrastructure by:
- Ensuring **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.
- Distributing traffic efficiently to prevent **server overload**.
- Enhancing **latency and response times** for end-users.
- Supporting **horizontal scaling** in cloud-based architectures.

This addition enhances the project's completeness by covering a critical aspect of internet traffic management.
