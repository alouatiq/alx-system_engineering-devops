# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

![Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure](./diagrams/2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.png)

This file describes a secured and monitored infrastructure to ensure encrypted traffic and proactive issue detection.

## Infrastructure Components
- **3 servers** (same as distributed infrastructure).
- **Firewalls:** Protect servers from unauthorized access.
- **SSL certificate:** Enables HTTPS for secure communication.
- **Monitoring clients:** Collect data for performance and error analysis.

## Key Explanations:
1. **Why add these components?**
   - Firewalls: Prevent unauthorized access and attacks.
   - SSL: Encrypts communication between users and the server.
   - Monitoring: Tracks server health and performance metrics.

2. **Why serve traffic over HTTPS?**
   HTTPS encrypts data, ensuring security and privacy for users.

3. **How does the monitoring tool collect data?**
   Monitoring agents collect metrics (CPU, memory usage, etc.) and send them to a centralized platform like Sumologic.

4. **How to monitor web server QPS?**
   Use monitoring tools to analyze query logs or enable real-time metrics collection for HTTP requests.

## Issues:
- **Terminating SSL at the load balancer:** End-to-end encryption is not maintained.
- **Single MySQL writer:** Can become a bottleneck.
- **Identical server components:** No separation of concerns, leading to potential performance bottlenecks.
