    Recursively queries the Reddit API, parses titles of all hot articles,

    Prints results in descending order by count, then ascending order by word.

    Args:
        subreddit (str): The subreddit to query.
        word_list (list): List of words to search for in post titles.
        after (str): The "after" pagination token, used in recursive calls.
        counts (dict): Running tally of counts for each keyword.
        freq (dict): Frequency map for handling duplicates in word_list.

    Returns:
        None. (Prints output or prints nothing
